										<h2>A Song of Nodes & Edges</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/tyler-carty/a-song-of-nodes-and-edges/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" class="image fit" title="Download Zip"><img src="./images/asonae.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This site aims to improve your understanding of the complex and incredibly well written character interactions within the book series "A Song of Ice and Fire", written by George R. R. Martin.
										The major houses from the series are shown below, each with a colour that will be used in the character network.
										The visualisation makes use of the D3.js library to create a network of character interactions and family/friend relationships throughout the book series.
										A live demonstration of this application is available on <a href="https://tyler-cartwright.github.io/">this site</a>.

									<a href="https://github.com/tyler-carty/air-traffic-controller-game/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" class="image fit" title="Download Zip"><img src="./images/atc.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This is a game that I have developed with a team during my second year at the University of Derby using the PyGame library.
										The full development of the game was completed in 4 days, including design, programming, testing and deployment.
										It is a game that involves the player controlling a plane to avoid collisions with other planes as they land, and more details are shown in the game tutorial when running.
										The game is designed to be played on a desktop computer, the full source code & executable can be found at
										<a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1KowBjReTyiC4A8zEcCNmay1A6yLlgeSR">this address</a>

										<h2>Maths Games for KS3 Outreach</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/tyler-carty/maths-games-for-outreach/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" class="image fit" title="Download Zip"><img src="./images/MGFO.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This is a project that I have developed, along with a team, for my second year at the University of Derby.
										The project was to develop a series of games that could be used in a KS3 Outreach programme for mathematics students in the hopes that more children will take an interest in maths.
										We each developed a mini-game in Python, and the games were compiled together to create a launcher with a variety of choices for the students.
										The full executable can be found by interacting with the images above, and the source code of my mini-game (Angle Onslaught) can be found at <a href="https://github.com/tyler-carty/angle-onslaught/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">this address.</a>

									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/tyler-carty/retail-management/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" class="image fit" title="Download Zip"><img src="./images/retailmanager.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										This is a project that I have developed for my second year at the University of Derby. It is a web application that allows users to manage their retail business in a simple and intuitive manner.
										The application is designed to be used by both the business owner and the staff, and the business owner can manage staff, create stock audits etc... while the staff can serve customers, check stock levels
										and generate barcodes for items. This application is built using PHP and Javascript, and is deployed on a server using Apache and MySQL.

									<a href="https://github.com/tyler-carty/graphics-modelling/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" class="image fit" title="Download Zip"><img src="images/graphics.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										A complex application that implements matrix manipulation, complex mathematics and object-oriented programming techniques
										to demonstrate a presentation of models to the user. Created as part of my Graphics module at the University of Derby for 
										which I received a 1st class grade.

									<a href="https://github.com/tyler-carty/obsidian-pickaxe/archive/refs/heads/1.18.zip" class="image fit" title="Download Zip"><img src="images/obsidianpickaxe.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										With this being my first introduction to Java, I thought that the most mainstream place to start would be Minecraft. By using the Fabric API,
										and their example mod, I was able to implement an Obsidian Pickaxe item into the game. Inheriting characteristics from existing game items and
										creating a new tier of mining capabilities.

									<p>
										My first project involving networked programming, concurrent processing & encryption as well as being another project to make use of the ever-useful object-orientation.
										This project was created for my Networks & Security module at the University of Derby for which I recieved a 1st class grade.

									<a href="https://github.com/tyler-carty/infocard-plugins/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" class="image fit" title="Download Zip"><img src="images/infocards.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										A project that required me to build plugins for an existing code-base, allowing the user to manage and store more types of information than the given
										"Notes" card. This project improved my understanding of object-orientation and introduced me to the idea of building upon an existing code-base that
										was not made by myself. This project was created for my Programming II module at the University of Derby for which I recieved a 1st class grade.

									<a href="https://github.com/tyler-carty/auto-vendor-web-app/archive/refs/heads/main.zip" class="image fit" title="Download Zip"><img src="images/auto-vendor.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										A comprehensive web application that allows users to manage a vehicle rental company with rentals, staff details, data visualisation and more.
										I was driven to research and explore the best programming techniques to be able to reach such a reliable and professional
										final product. I am most proud of this project due to the way that I was forced out of my comfort zone to utilise so many techniques.
										This project makes use of a plethora of website technologies such as HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, MySQL & the Google Visualisation API
										which resulted in a diverse product that could easily be used in a real-life scenario. You can find a video presentation
										of the website at <a href="https://vimeo.com/670212905" title="Play Presentation">this address.</a>
